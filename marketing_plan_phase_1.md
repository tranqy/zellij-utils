## Soft Launch (Week 2)

### 4. Early Adopter Outreach

#### Phase 1 Community Feedback (Revised Strategy)
Focus on technical communities for early validation and feedback:

**Reddit Communities (Primary):**
- [ ] **r/commandline** - Active community for command line tools and utilities
- [ ] **r/programming** - General programming community, good for technical tools
- [ ] **r/opensource** - Specifically for open source projects
- [ ] **r/zellij** / **r/tmux** - Terminal multiplexer specific communities
- [ ] **r/unixporn** - Users who love customizing their terminal setups
- [ ] **r/bashscripting** - Since the project is shell-based

**Technical Communities:**
- [ ] **Hacker News** - Has active discussions about Zellij vs tmux, very engaged audience
- [ ] **Stack Overflow** - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange for technical questions
- [ ] **Ask Ubuntu** - Community questions about terminal tools

**Platform-Specific:**
- [ ] **GitHub Discussions** - On the main zellij repository
- [ ] **Zellij Discord** - Direct access to the core community
- [ ] **Dev.to** - Developer blogging platform with engaged community
#### Phase 1 Strategy
**Focus on technical benefits:**
- Smart session naming and workflow automation
- Problem-solving approach to Zellij usability
- Shell scripting best practices
- Real examples with screenshots of functions in action

**Recommended posting order:**
1. Start with **r/commandline** and **r/zellij** for most targeted feedback
2. Expand to **r/programming** and **Hacker News** once refined
3. Use **Dev.to** for technical blog posts about the project

- [ ] **Reddit post template:**
  ```
  Title: "Built a collection of shell utilities to supercharge Zellij workflows"
  
  I've been using Zellij for a while but found myself repeating the same 
  session management tasks. So I built zellij-utils - a collection of shell 
  functions that add smart session naming, project detection, and workflow automation.
  
  Key features:
  - Smart session naming (auto-detects git repos)
  - One-command development workspaces
  - Fuzzy session selection
  - Pre-configured layouts for common workflows
  
  Demo video: [link]
  GitHub: [link]
  
  Looking for feedback from the community - what features would be most useful to you?
  ```

#### Content Marketing Start (Phase 1 Focus)
- [ ] **Publish launch blog post** on dev.to (primary focus)
- [ ] **Create technical documentation** for community posts
- [ ] **Phase 2-3: Create "Introduction to Zellij Utils" thread** on Twitter
- [ ] **Phase 2-3: Share demo video** on YouTube and social media
- [ ] **Phase 2-3: Write guest post** for relevant technical blogs
