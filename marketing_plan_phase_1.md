  Title: "Built a collection of shell utilities to supercharge Zellij workflows"
  
  I've been using Zellij for a while but found myself repeating the same 
  session management tasks. So I built zellij-utils - a collection of shell 
  functions that add smart session naming, project detection, and workflow automation.
  
  Key features:
  - Smart session naming (auto-detects git repos)
  - One-command development workspaces
  - Fuzzy session selection
  - Pre-configured layouts for common workflows
  
  Demo video: [link]
  GitHub: [link]
  
  Looking for feedback from the community - what features would be most useful to you?
