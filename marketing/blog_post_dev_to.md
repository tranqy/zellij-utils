# I Built a Set of Shell Utilities to Supercharge Zellij Workflows

## The Problem with Terminal Multiplexers

If you're like me, you've probably spent countless hours juggling terminal sessions. You know the drill:

- Start a new project → open terminal → remember what to name the session
- Switch between 5 different sessions → which one was `my-app` again?
- Want to code, run tests, check logs, and monitor git → manually set up 4 panes every time
- Work on a remote server → lose your session when you disconnect

After years of using tmux and recently switching to [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij), I realized I was spending way too much mental energy on session management instead of actual work.

## Enter Zellij Utils

So I built **zellij-utils** — a collection of shell functions that make Zellij session management actually *smart*. Think of it as "batteries included" for your terminal multiplexer.

### The Magic: Smart Session Names

The core function `zj` automatically figures out what to name your session:

```bash
# In a git repo? Uses repo name
cd ~/work/my-awesome-api && zj
# → Creates/attaches to session "my-awesome-api"

# In a project directory? Uses directory name  
cd ~/projects/portfolio-site && zj
# → Creates/attaches to session "portfolio-site"

# In your home? Sensible default
cd ~ && zj
# → Creates/attaches to session "home"
```

No more `zellij attach` followed by "what did I call that session again?"

### Development Layouts on Demand

Pre-configured layouts that actually work:

```bash
zjdev my-project
# Instantly creates a session with:
# - Editor pane
# - Terminal for commands  
# - Git status pane
# - Logs/output pane
```

### Safe Session Management

Interactive session deletion with confirmations:

```bash
zjd                    # Interactive selection with fzf
zjd old-project       # Delete specific session (with confirmation)
zjd --all             # Delete all except current (with confirmation)
```

## Why Zellij Over tmux?

I migrated from tmux to Zellij for several reasons:

1. **Better discoverability** — No more memorizing arcane key combinations
2. **Modern UI** — Clean, informative status bars and pane information
3. **Sane defaults** — Works great out of the box without extensive configuration
4. **Plugin ecosystem** — Growing community and extensibility

Zellij-utils builds on these strengths by solving the "session management overhead" problem.

## Perfect for Remote Development

One of my favorite use cases: I run long-running AI development sessions on a remote server. With zellij-utils, I can:

1. Start a development session from my laptop
2. Close the laptop and head out
3. SSH in from my phone and reattach to the *exact same session*
4. Everything is exactly as I left it — running processes, open files, chat histories

This workflow is game-changing for:
- **AI/ML development** — Keep models and training running
- **Remote work** — Persistent development environments  
- **Mobile productivity** — Quick server checks on the go

## Installation & Try It Out

Getting started takes 30 seconds:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

The installer:
- ✅ Sets up shell integration (bash/zsh)
- ✅ Copies layouts and configurations  
- ✅ Never overwrites existing configs
- ✅ Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL

Then restart your terminal or `source ~/.bashrc` and you're ready to go.

## Technical Highlights

For the developers in the audience, here's what makes this project solid:

- **🚀 CI/CD Testing** — Automated tests in Ubuntu and Alpine Linux containers
- **🛡️ Security-First** — Input validation, injection prevention, dependency safety
- **🔧 Production Ready** — Complete installation validation and compatibility testing
- **📊 Performance Optimized** — Smart caching and minimal overhead
- **🌐 Cross-Platform** — Bash/Zsh support across Linux, macOS, and WSL

All tests run in isolated Docker containers, so you know it works reliably across environments.

## What's Next?

I'm looking for feedback from the terminal productivity community:

- **What session management pain points do you have?**
- **Which features would be most valuable to you?**
- **How do you currently handle persistent remote sessions?**
