# Reddit Post Templates for Zellij Utils Launch

## r/commandline - Technical Focus

**Title:** "Built shell utilities to supercharge Zellij workflows with smart session management"

**Post:**
```
I've been using Zellij for a while but found myself repeating the same session management tasks over and over. So I built zellij-utils - a collection of shell functions that add intelligent session naming, project detection, and workflow automation.

Key features:
• Smart session naming (auto-detects git repos, projects, special directories)
• One-command development workspaces with pre-configured layouts
• Interactive session management with fzf integration
• Safe session deletion with confirmations
• Perfect for persistent remote development workflows

Technical highlights:
• Automated CI/CD testing in containerized environments
• Security-first design with input validation
• Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, WSL)
• Zero-dependency installation

Example workflow:
```bash
cd ~/work/my-project && zj        # Auto-creates "my-project" session
zjdev                             # Instant dev layout with editor/terminal/git panes
zjd                               # Interactive session deletion with fzf
```

Installation: `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/main/scripts/install.sh)`

Looking for feedback from the community - what session management pain points do you have? What features would be most useful?

## r/zellij - Zellij Community Focus  

**Title:** "Collection of shell utilities to streamline Zellij session management and development workflows"

**Post:**
```
Fellow Zellij users! I love using Zellij but was spending too much mental energy on session management. So I created zellij-utils to automate the repetitive parts.

What it does:
🎯 Smart session names - automatically uses git repo names, project directories, or sensible defaults
🚀 Instant dev workspaces - pre-configured layouts with editor, terminal, git, and logs panes  
🔒 Safe session management - interactive deletion with confirmations
⚡ Remote-friendly - perfect for persistent development on servers

Real workflow example:
- Start development session on desktop: `zjdev my-api`
- Close laptop, head out
- SSH from phone: `zj my-api` 
- Everything exactly as you left it - running processes, open files, chat histories

This is especially powerful for:
• AI/ML development (keep models running)
• Long-running builds and processes
• Remote development workflows
• Mobile productivity (quick server checks)

The project includes comprehensive testing and works across Linux, macOS, and WSL.

Repository: https://github.com/tranqy/zellij-utils
Quick install: `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/main/scripts/install.sh)`

Would love feedback from the Zellij community! What workflow improvements would you find most valuable?

## r/tmux - Migration Angle

**Title:** "Migrated from tmux to Zellij and built utilities to enhance the workflow"

**Post:**
```
After years with tmux, I recently migrated to Zellij and love the modern approach. Better discoverability, cleaner UI, sane defaults - but I missed some of my tmux workflow automation.

So I built zellij-utils to bring that productivity back:

Migration benefits I've found:
✅ No more memorizing complex key combinations
✅ Better pane information and status bars  
✅ Layouts that actually make sense out of the box
✅ Growing plugin ecosystem

What zellij-utils adds:
• Intelligent session naming (git repos, projects, directories)
• One-command development environments  
• Interactive session management
• Perfect for remote/persistent workflows

For tmux users considering the switch, this handles the "session management overhead" that you might be used to scripting yourself.

Key workflow improvement:
```bash
# Instead of: tmux new-session -d -s project-name -c /path/to/project
# Just: cd /path/to/project && zj
```

The migration has been smooth, and Zellij's modern approach + these utilities have made me way more productive.

Anyone else made the tmux → Zellij migration? What workflow improvements did you implement?

## r/opensource - Open Source Project Focus

**Title:** "Open sourced my Zellij workflow utilities - smart session management for terminal multiplexers"

**Post:**
```
Just open sourced zellij-utils, a project I've been working on to solve terminal multiplexer session management friction.

The problem: Spending mental energy on session naming, layout setup, and management instead of actual work.

The solution: Shell utilities that intelligently handle session naming, provide instant development workspaces, and make session management safe and intuitive.

Open source highlights:
🔧 MIT licensed - use it anywhere
🚀 Comprehensive CI/CD with containerized testing  
🛡️ Security-first design with input validation
📖 Extensive documentation and examples
🌍 Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, WSL)
🤝 Welcoming to contributors

The project emphasizes:
• Production-ready code quality
• Zero external dependencies
• Backward compatibility
• Clear documentation
• Community-driven development

Perfect for developers who want persistent remote development environments - start a session on your main machine, disconnect, and reattach from anywhere with everything exactly as you left it.

Repository: https://github.com/tranqy/zellij-utils
Installation: `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/main/scripts/install.sh)`
Discussions: https://github.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/discussions

Looking for:
• Feature feedback and suggestions
• Contributors interested in terminal productivity tools  
• Testing across different environments
• Documentation improvements

What open source terminal tools have improved your workflow?

## r/programming - Developer Focus

**Title:** "Built smart session management utilities for Zellij terminal multiplexer"

**Post:**
```
Developers: how much time do you spend thinking about terminal session names and layouts?

I was losing productivity to terminal multiplexer overhead, so I built zellij-utils to automate the repetitive parts.

Core concept: Smart defaults that just work
• Auto-detect git repo names for sessions
• Instant development layouts (editor + terminal + git + logs)
• Safe interactive session management
• Optimized for remote/persistent workflows

Implementation highlights:
• Pure shell scripting - no compiled dependencies
• Comprehensive test suite with containerized CI/CD
• Security-focused with input validation
• Configuration-driven behavior
• Cross-platform compatibility

Real productivity gain example:
Instead of manually setting up 4 panes every time I start working, `zjdev` creates my entire development environment in one command.

Perfect for:
- Remote development (persistent sessions survive disconnects)
- AI/ML workflows (keep models running)
- Long-running processes
- Mobile productivity (SSH access from anywhere)

The project emphasizes code quality with automated testing across Ubuntu and Alpine Linux environments.

GitHub: https://github.com/tranqy/zellij-utils
Quick start: `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tranqy/zellij-utils/main/scripts/install.sh)`

What terminal productivity tools have changed your development workflow?

## r/bashscripting - Shell Scripting Focus

**Title:** "Shell script collection for intelligent Zellij session management"

**Post:**
```
Fellow shell scripters! I've been working on a set of bash/zsh functions to automate Zellij terminal multiplexer workflows and thought you might find the implementation interesting.

Technical approach:
• Pure shell scripting - no external dependencies
• Smart session naming with project detection logic
• Configuration-driven behavior with sensible defaults
• Caching for performance optimization
• Comprehensive error handling and input validation

Key scripting techniques used:
```bash
# Smart session naming with fallback chain
get_session_name() {
    # Git repo name > project detection > directory mapping > basename
    local name
    name=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename)
    name=${name:-$(detect_project_name)}
    name=${name:-$(map_special_directory)}
    name=${name:-$(basename "$PWD")}
    echo "${name//[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]/-}"  # Sanitize for zellij
}
```

The project includes:
• Interactive session deletion with fzf integration
• Pre-configured layout management
• Cross-shell compatibility (bash/zsh)
• Containerized testing infrastructure
• Security-focused input handling

Interesting challenges solved:
- Session name sanitization for special characters
- Safe session deletion with current session protection  
- Configuration management without overwriting user settings
- Cross-platform path handling
