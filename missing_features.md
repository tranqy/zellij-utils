# Missing Features Analysis

## Realistic & Valuable Features

### User Experience Enhancements
*   **Command-Line Autocompletion:** Implement autocompletion for commands and arguments to improve usability.
*   **"Did You Mean?" Suggestions:** Offer suggestions for mistyped commands.
*   **Enhanced Session Naming:** Add more sophisticated and customizable rules for session naming beyond the current git/project detection.

### Workflow Enhancements
*   **Additional Layout Presets:** Create specialized layouts for different development workflows:
    - Data science (jupyter, terminal, file browser, plots)
    - Web development (editor, dev server, browser preview, logs)
    - DevOps (terminal, monitoring, logs, config editor)
    - Mobile development (editor, simulator, logs, debugger)

*   **Git Integration Improvements:** 
    - Branch-specific session naming and management
    - Automatic session switching when changing git branches
    - Git status integration in session lists

*   **Development Context Awareness:**
    - Docker container context detection and integration
    - Kubernetes context awareness for containerized development
    - Virtual environment detection and activation

### Configuration & Flexibility
*   **Workspace Templates:** Pre-configured setups for common project types (React, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
*   **Configuration Backup and Restore:** Simple commands to backup/restore user configurations and custom layouts.

## Rejected Features (Over-engineering/Scope Creep)

The following features were considered but rejected as they don't align with zellij-utils' philosophy as a lightweight shell script collection:

- **Plugin/Extension System** - Adds unnecessary complexity; Zellij itself provides plugin capabilities
- **Theme and UI Customization** - This is Zellij's responsibility, not the utilities
- **Session Snapshots/Templating** - Already handled by Zellij's native layout system
- **Cross-Platform Support** - Adds complexity without clear value for a shell script collection
- **Integration with Project Management Tools** - Scope creep beyond terminal productivity
- **Auto-Update Mechanism** - Unnecessary for shell scripts; users can git pull
- **Interactive Tutorial/Walkthrough** - Better handled through documentation and examples
- **Auto-Configuration/Setup Doctor** - The install script already handles this appropriately

## Priority Focus

The most valuable additions would be:
1. **Command-line autocompletion** - Expected in modern CLI tools
2. **Additional layout presets** - Leverages the project's core strength
3. **Enhanced git integration** - Builds on existing smart session naming
4. **Workspace templates** - Natural extension of current layout system

These maintain the project's lightweight, focused nature while adding genuine value to the user experience.
