# Introducing Zellij Utils

We're excited to introduce **Zellij Utils** - a collection of powerful shell utilities designed to streamline your [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) terminal multiplexer workflows.

## The Story Behind Zellij Utils

As developers, we found ourselves repeating the same session management tasks over and over. Creating sessions, naming them consistently, switching between projects, and managing multiple development environments became a daily friction point. We loved Zellij's features but wanted something that could automate the repetitive parts.

That's where Zellij Utils was born.

## What Makes Zellij Utils Different?

### 🧠 Smart Session Management

No more manual session naming. Zellij Utils automatically detects your context:

- **Git repositories**: Uses the repo name
- **Project directories**: Detects package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod
- **Special locations**: `$HOME` becomes "home", `~/.config/*` becomes "config"

```bash
# In a git repo called "my-api"
zj  # Creates/attaches to session "my-api"

# In your dotfiles
cd ~/.config/nvim
zj  # Creates/attaches to session "config"
```

### 🌐 Persistent & Remote Workflows

Perfect for long-running processes like AI agents, development servers, or complex builds:

1. Start a session on your desktop
2. Disconnect and head out
3. Seamlessly re-attach from anywhere via SSH
4. Your processes, chats, and work continue exactly where you left off

### ⚡ Effortless Development Workspaces

Jump directly into pre-configured layouts:

```bash
# Create development workspace with editor, terminal, logs, git tabs
zjdev my-project dev

# Quick project-specific session
zjwork api-server  # Multi-pane setup ready to go
```

### 🛡️ Safety First

Interactive session management with confirmations:

```bash
# Safe session deletion with fuzzy selection
zjd  # Shows list, requires confirmation

# Bulk operations with safety checks
zjd --pattern "temp-*" --force  # Only after confirmation
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### AI and Agent Development
Keep your models running and chats active 24/7. Perfect for:
- Long-running AI training processes
- Persistent agent conversations
- Model fine-tuning workflows

### Remote Development
- Start builds on your work machine
- Check progress from home
- Mobile productivity via SSH

### Team Development
- Consistent session naming across team members
- Shared development layouts
- Standardized project workflows

## Getting Started

Installation is simple:

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/tranqy/zellij-utils.git
cd zellij-utils
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh

# Add to your shell
echo 'source ~/.config/shell/zellij-utils.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## What's Next?

We're building a community around productive terminal workflows. Here's what's coming:

- **Community Layouts**: Share your custom layouts
- **Plugin Integration**: Deeper Zellij plugin support  
- **Multi-User Sessions**: Collaborative development features
- **Cloud Sync**: Synchronize configurations across machines
