# Zellij Utils

A collection of powerful, configuration-driven shell utilities to streamline your [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) workflows.

**Why use Zellij Utils?**

-   **Smart Session Management**: Automatically name sessions based on your current project, git repository, or directory. No more `zellij attach` followed by hunting for the right session.
-   **Effortless Workspaces**: Jump directly into pre-defined development layouts (`editor`, `git`, `logs`, etc.) with a single command.
-   **Safety and Control**: Interactively delete sessions with confirmations, preventing accidental data loss.
-   **Highly Configurable**: Customize everything from session naming conventions to auto-start behavior.

Stop thinking about managing your multiplexer and start focusing on your work.

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zellij-utils.git
cd zellij-utils

# 2. Run the installer
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh

# 3. Add the following line to your .bashrc or .zshrc
source ~/.config/shell/zellij-utils.sh
```

The installer copies the necessary files to your system. It will not overwrite existing configurations without your permission.

## âœ¨ Core Features

### Smart Session Attachment (`zj`)

The `zj` command is the heart of Zellij Utils. It intelligently creates or attaches to a session with a sensible name, so you don't have to.

-   **In a git repository?** It uses the repo name (`my-project`).
-   **In a project directory?** It uses the directory name (`api-server`).
-   **In your home directory?** It names the session `home`.

```bash
# Navigate to your project and start a session
cd ~/work/my-cool-project
zj # Attaches to or creates a session named "my-cool-project"

# Create a session with a custom name
zj my-session

# Create a session with a specific layout
zj my-session dev
```

### Development Layouts (`zjdev`)

Instantly create a development workspace with a pre-defined layout.

```bash
# Start a dev session for the current project
zjdev # Creates a session with editor, terminal, and git panes

# Specify a project name and layout
zjdev my-api dev
```

### Session Management

-   `zjl`: List all active Zellij sessions.
-   `zjk <name>`: Kill a session by name.
-   `zjd`: Interactively delete sessions using `fzf` (if installed).
-   `zjd <name>`: Delete a specific session with a confirmation prompt.
-   `zjd --all`: Delete all sessions except the one you're in.
-   `zjs <name>`: Switch to a running session.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Zellij Utils is designed to be highly configurable. After running the installer, you can modify the configuration files located in `~/.config/zellij-utils/`.

-   `zellij-utils.conf`: Controls core behavior like auto-starting, session name sanitization, and caching.
-   `session-naming.conf`: Defines the rules for how smart session naming works, including project markers (e.g., `package.json`) and custom directory mappings.

For detailed configuration options, see the comments within the generated configuration files.
